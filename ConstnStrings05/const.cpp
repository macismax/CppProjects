	//Create a loop in which the program
	// 1) asks the user to enter a word,
	// 2) tells the user if the word is spelled correctly or not
	// 3) Goes back to the top of the loop and repeats.
	//  Enter a word: wolf
	//  Good job, that is a real word!
	//  Enter a word: compooter
	//  Wrong!  That is a mispelled word!
	//  (Etc..)
	//To solve this, use the following dictionary file containing 202,413 words to get a list
	//of valid words: https://faculty.utrgv.edu/robert.schweller/CS2380/notes/largeDictionary.txt




	//If you are stuck:  First create a size 202,413 array of strings, and read in the words from the dictionary file into this array.
	//Next, enter a loop that:
		//Asks the user to enter a word
		//Does a binary search of your array for that word
		//If it finds it, tells the user congratulations.  Otherwise, tells them they are dumb.
